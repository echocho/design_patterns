## Scenario ##

You are a travel agent and the customers you are working with are usually those who with already have a plan in mind. 
For instance, they plan their vacation ahead, knowing which hotel is the best to stay, and pick restaurant on their own.
But what they need you, is to make reservations and the like. 

So you want to write a VacationPlaner that stores and print out customers' itinerary.
It could be a bit tricky, as customers spend different numbers of day, some of them need to stay in a hotel 
but some of them don't; some need to book special events and some don't.

To make it easier, here is a list of possible items a customer needs:
    - hotel reservation
    - special events
    - restaurant booking
    - tickets for museum
    
And customers can go on their trip for as many days as they like.
