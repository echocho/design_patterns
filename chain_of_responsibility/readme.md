## Scenario ##
You are a software engineer working in a company manufacturing toys for all ages. 
Today you receive a request from the PM, saying that the company is receiving a flood of email. 
The other team has analyzed the emails and found that there are mainly four types of email:

    - fans' mail
    - complaints
    - requests
    - spam 
    
Different type of email goes to different department:
    
    - fans' mails go to the CEO
    - compaints go to legal department
    - requests go to business department
    - spam needs to be deleted
    
Your colleagues have worked on some detectors to detect the category of each email 
and your job is to use these detectors to handle incoming emails.
